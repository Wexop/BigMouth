# Big Mouth

Add a new monster to the game. Be careful, sometimes an item can hide a monster...

There are a lot of configs to so you can custom BigMouth behavior !

A config 'canBeEveryItem' can be enabled so BigMouth can transform to any crap item, even modded ones !

For any issue or suggestion, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub project :)
